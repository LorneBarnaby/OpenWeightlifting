              OpenWeightlifting are pleased to announce that we are now planning
              our first - club run - league. We aim to run the league during the
              first 2 weeks of December 2023 and look to run it in a similar
              format to virtual competitions hosted by other federations.

              How it works
            </h2>
            <p className="text-center">
              The league will be run over 2 weeks, and each registered affiliate
              will be responsible for recording and uploading their gym /club
              scores. In a typical competition format, you have 6 attempts in
              total, 3 for snatch and 3 for clean & jerk. Each attempt will be
              recorded from the front and the registered club affiliate will be
              responsible for your weigh-in and logging your scores. You do NOT
              need to pay for a membership with us or be registered with your
              National Governing Body.

            <h2 className="text-2xl text-center font-bold mb-2">The rules</h2>
            <p className="text-center">
              Typical weightlifting competition rules apply but we are NOT
              enforcing a strict press-out rule, a lift will only be disallowed
              should you exceed approximately 30degrees of elbow flexion. You do
              not need a singlet, although you can wear one if you think it adds
              some KGs to your total. Weigh-ins are held by the club affiliate
              and it is up to yourself how light you want to be on the scale. As
              always, no straps.

          <div className="mb-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl text-center font-bold mb-2">The cost</h2>
            <p className="text-center">
              We are looking to charge around Â£10GBP per entry which will be
              invoiced to the club affiliate post-submission of scores and prior
              to winners being drawn. The breakdown of the fee is as follows,
              80% of all fees billed will be put towards the overall prize pot
              with the remainder going to further development of the
              OpenWeightlifting League platform and future events.
